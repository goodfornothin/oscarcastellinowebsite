        <h2>Oscar Dom Victor Castellino</h2>
        <p><strong>Born:</strong> 8th May 1986, Santa Cruz West, Mumbai — in a car on the way to the hospital on Swami Vivekananda Road</p>
        <p>Oscar Castellino is an international baritone, ensemble singer at the Royal Opera House, and composer of the Mars anthem "Rise to Mars". His journey from software engineer to opera singer began when Patricia Rozario discovered his extraordinary talent during her concert tour of India.</p>
        <p>Today, Oscar has performed over 30 operatic roles across the UK, India, and beyond. He made his solo debut at Welsh National Opera as George Benton in <em>Dead Man Walking</em>, and The Times UK described his lead performance as James Meredith in <em>Kommilitonen!</em> as "a highlight."</p>

    <div class="bio-section">
      <h3>The Santa Cruz Connection</h3>
      <p>Oscar's father, Edmund Castellino (1940–2011), moved to Santa Cruz from Ajmer to join the State Bank of India in 1969. The family became part of Sacred Heart Parish, where Oscar's musical journey began.</p>
      <p>"The Santa Cruz music scene is very vibrant," Oscar recalls. "When attending church, I would hear wonderful singers. One I remember in particular was Gus D'Lima, who had a fabulous tenor voice. That made a lasting impact on me."</p>
      <p>Santa Cruz was also home to Patricia Rozario, whom Oscar's family always looked up to. It was she who would later hear his voice and encourage him to pursue opera in London. Oscar also sang in the Sacred Heart Choir with Father Aniceto Nazareth — a composer whose hymns are sung worldwide — and with Mimosa Almeida Pinto for Christmas masses attended by large congregations.</p>
      <p>Later, Oscar joined the Stop Gaps Choral Ensemble under Alfred D'Souza in Bandra, which enhanced his performance skills and stagecraft.</p>

    <div class="bio-section">
      <h3>The Discovery</h3>
      <p>Oscar studied physics at St. Xavier's College, Mumbai, and worked as an analytical software programmer. His life took a dramatic turn when renowned soprano Patricia Rozario heard him sing during her initiative "Giving Voice to India" in 2010. He received his first vocal lesson at the age of 23.</p>
      <p>Oscar then worked with famed baritone Tom Krause and world-renowned pianist Norman Shetler at a masterclass in Salzburg. Both were keen that he pursue a career in singing. Guided by Rozario, he auditioned successfully for the prestigious Royal College of Music, London.</p>
      <p>His father passed away in April 2011, just before Oscar left for London — but Edmund knew his son had been admitted to the Royal College of Music. "He was very keen on my opera singing and would play Pavarotti's sacred recordings like Panis Angelicus, hoping one day we could sing it together. It meant everything to me that he knew I was moving to London to study music before his death."</p>

      <h3>A Voice for Goa — Konkani Heritage</h3>
      <p>Goan Konkani and Portuguese music was part of Oscar's upbringing. His grandfather, Gabriel Pais (1919–2004) from Curtorim — grandson of a Mestri — introduced him to songs like "Encosta Tua Cabecinha", "Cadiza Za", and "Tambde Roza", and sang Konkani and Portuguese lullabies.</p>
      <p>Oscar's first experience singing in Konkani was at the Commonwealth Christmas Concert in London in 2020. The organizers suggested he sing something from his culture, and he performed "Mari Matek Ballok Zala" by Manohar Rai Sardessai. Conductor Carlo Rizzi noted that "the Konkani language brought out something refreshing in his voice."</p>
      <p>In 2025, Oscar unearthed writings by his grandfather Gabriel Pais in Portuguese and Konkani and adapted them to music. He also received poems from Manohar Rai Sardessai's son, Sunil Sardessai. Working with Professor Umesh Manohar Sardessai on pronunciation and delivery, Oscar created the "Concerto de Natal" with the Museum of Goa and founded "Oscar Castellino & The Timemakers" ensemble featuring Jason Quadros (piano), Chelsea D'Silva (vocals), Nahil Flores (ghumot), and Senon D'Souza (violin).</p>
      <p>"I love when my performances resonate with people, bringing out memories and emotions or just entertaining them thoroughly... The hope is this music revisits Goan homes across the globe in a post-dinner sing along with friends and family."</p>
