      "description": "About the Instructor.\n\nOscar Castellino is a performer with the Royal Ballet and Opera as an opera singer. Oscar has 20 years experience in salsa and bachata. Oscar’s Rogue style of dance evolved over the years bringing his experience on stage at the highest level as an actor-singer onto the dance floor. He developed a style that combines the best of both worlds into the Rogue style.\n\nThis particular workshop is titled Rogue Resonance\n\nMessage from Oscar:\n\nResonance is something second nature to a singer. The singer uses their surroundings to enhance their sound. It's no different with a dancer - the music, their partner, the temperature, their mood, the lighting and the overall atmosphere must be a part of the dance they create.\n\nThis workshop will take whatever skill level you have as a dancer and enhance it with better awareness of the concepts of Rogue Resonance. We will have 6 to 10 people to keep it effective.\n\nI advise easy clothing and shoes. We will work at a lovely church hall in Camden so we would prefer shoes that do not mark the wooden flooring. There will be a kitchenette with a kettle and I will bring along tea and coffee.\n\nDarryl will be taking some bits of footage that we can use for further promotion so please let me know if you do not wish to be included in the footage.",
