  "longBiography": "<p>Oscar Castellino is an international baritone and the composer of the Mars anthem, <em>Rise to Mars</em>. Born in a car on a busy street in Mumbai, he traces his roots to Goa. Originally a software engineer, he was discovered for his operatic talent by renowned soprano <strong>Patricia Rozario</strong> during her concert tour of India.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Early Life</strong></h3><p>Although born in Mumbai, Oscar’s family later relocated to <strong>Mussoorie</strong>, a hill station at the foothills of the Himalayas. It was here that his fascination with space travel and passion for music first developed. His father conducted both the school and church choirs, while the pristine night skies of Mussoorie—unobscured by city lights—made Oscar wonder about the vastness of the universe and what lay beyond the stars.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Software Developer</strong></h3><p>After completing secondary school, Oscar moved back to Mumbai, where he pursued a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Physics</strong> at <strong>St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai</strong>. A promising student, he was given the opportunity to assist in research labs at the <strong>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)</strong> and was also selected for the prestigious <strong>National Initiative on Undergraduate Science (NIUS)</strong> program.</p>",

  "description": "About the Instructor.\n\nOscar Castellino is a performer with the Royal Ballet and Opera as an opera singer. Oscar has 20 years experience in salsa and bachata. Oscar’s Rogue style of dance evolved over the years bringing his experience on stage at the highest level as an actor-singer onto the dance floor. He developed a style that combines the best of both worlds into the Rogue style.\n\nThis particular workshop is titled Rogue Resonance\n\nMessage from Oscar:\n\nResonance is something second nature to a singer. The singer uses their surroundings to enhance their sound. It's no different with a dancer - the music, their partner, the temperature, their mood, the lighting and the overall atmosphere must be a part of the dance they create.\n\nThis workshop will take whatever skill level you have as a dancer and enhance it with better awareness of the concepts of Rogue Resonance. We will have 6 to 10 people to keep it effective.\n\nI advise easy clothing and shoes. We will work at a lovely church hall in Camden so we would prefer shoes that do not mark the wooden flooring. There will be a kitchenette with a kettle and I will bring along tea and coffee.\n\nDarryl will be taking some bits of footage that we can use for further promotion so please let me know if you do not wish to be included in the footage.",
