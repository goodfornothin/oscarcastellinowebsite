It was here that his fascination with space travel and passion for music first developed. His father conducted both the school and church choirs, while the pristine night skies of Mussoorie—unobscured by city lights—made Oscar wonder about the vastness of the universe and what lay beyond the stars.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Software Developer</strong></h3><p>After completing secondary school, Oscar moved back to Mumbai, where he pursued a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Physics</strong> at <strong>St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai</strong>.
